Dear Smart Methods
first of all, I have created html page that let you create database, then you can go to engine control page. I used bootsstrap to make the page compiable with all devices.
in the engine control page you can turn it on or off and you can modify the engines values and there is a button to save the values. it will save the values to the database automatically.
also, there is a button to show the engines final result.

regards,
